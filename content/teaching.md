<br>
Train graduate TAs to be independent course instructors for intro-level statistical courses, Stat 218 and Stat 380. This course aims to help those TAs prepare their teaching portfolios, write quizzes and exams with detail rubric and develop in-class activities.

- **STAT 380**: *Statistics and Applications*, Spring, Fall 2016, Spring 2018 (big session class, UNL).
<br>
The first calculus-based statistic course for undergraduate students. Topics include probability, random variable, probability distribution and expectation, t, F and chi-square sampling distributions, estimation and confidence interval, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis with applications. 

- **STAT 218**: *Introduction to Statistics*, Fall 2015, Fall 2016 (big session class, UNL).
<br>
The first statistic course for undergraduate students. The goal of this course is to teach students the practical application of statistical thinking to contemporary issues, collection and organization of data and statistical inference for decision making.
