## Vaccine effects

The manuscript [Real-World COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Rates against Infection in the Delta and Omicron Eras](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.01.22279492v1.full.pdf) (by Zhu, Y., Gu, J., Qiu, Y. and Chen, S. X.) estimates the real-world protection rates of vaccination (VPRs) against the SARS-Cov-2 infection. Main results are:

- The average VPR of the full vaccination was 82% (SE: 4%) and 61% (SE: 3%) in the pre-Delta and Delta-dominated periods, respectively.  
- The Omicron variant reduced the average VPR of the full vaccination to 39% (SE: 2%).  
- The booster dose restored the VPR to 63% (SE: 1%) which was significantly above the 50% threshold in the Omicron-dominated period.
